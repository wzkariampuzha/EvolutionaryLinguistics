<h1 align="center">Birth and Death of Lexemes in Closed Lexical Classes</h1>
This is the repository for the investigation into closed lexical classes in the [Google Ngrams](https://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv3.html) [English 1-grams February 2020 subcorpus](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/20200217/eng/eng-1-ngrams_exports.html). 
Manuscript is being finalized. Key findings will be posted here after paper is accepted to a journal. 

### Key notebooks
- *1. Closed Classes Pre-processing.ipynb*: Generates *whole_abstract_set.csv* and *positive_abstract_set.csv*. *whole_abstract_set.csv* is a dataset created by sampling 500 rare disease names and their synonyms from *GARD.csv* until &ge;50 abstracts had been returned or the search results were exhausted. Although ~25,000 abstracts were expected, 7699 unique abstracts were returned due to the limited research on rare diseases. After running each of these through the LSTM RNN classifier, the *positive_abstract_set.csv* was created from the abstracts which had an epidemiological probability >50%. *positive_abstract_set.csv* will be passed to *create_labeled_dataset_V2.ipynb*
- *2. Closed Classes Pre-processing.ipynb*: Uses [spaCy NER](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities) and rules I created iteratively to auto-label the dataset. Generates *epi_{train,val,test}_setV2.tsv* files
- *3. Investigate the Closed Classes Data.ipynb*: Generated new rules for labeling that improved the V2 set to create V3.2 set. Input: *epi_{train, val, test}_setV2.tsv* files Output: *epi_{train, val, test}_setV3.tsv* files

### Data files
