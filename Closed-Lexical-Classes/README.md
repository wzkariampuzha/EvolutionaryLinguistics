<h1 align="center">Birth and Death of Lexemes in Closed Lexical Classes</h1>

This is the repository for the investigation into closed lexical classes in the [Google Ngrams](https://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv3.html) [English 1-grams February 2020 subcorpus](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/20200217/eng/eng-1-ngrams_exports.html). 

### Significance
Dynamic [evolutionary](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06137) theories of language predict the birth and death of lexemes (words) throughout time. However, a key prediction of an evolutionary theory of language is demonstrating that grammatical/function words not only mutate, but are born, propagate, and die. These grammatical/function words overlap significantly with the groups of words that linguists call "Closed Lexical Classes". In fact, "closed" refers to the fact that these groups do not, or rarely ever, gain and lose members. Some closed lexical classes are pronouns, determiners, adpositions, conjunctions, and particles. In contrast, open lexical classes, which include nouns, adjectives, and verbs, are well known to gain and lose members rapidly.

[Previous studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00313) have shown the birth and death of lexemes in open lexical classes, but none have demonstrated the birth and death of lexemes in closed lexical classes *en masse*. This investigation into the [Google Ngrams English corpus](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1199644) aimed to do so by utilizing a novel linguistic framework transcribed into computational parameters.

### Key findings
Manuscript is being finalized for submission. Key findings will be added here after paper is accepted to a journal. 

### Key notebooks
- *1. Closed Classes Pre-processing.ipynb*: Inputs the raw Google 1-gram data (\*.gz), preprocesses it by filtering out unigrams which are not lexemes (exact parameters are described in the paper and found in the function *unigram_tests*) as well as all unigrams which are not [annotated](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2390470.2390499) with one of the closed lexical classes tags.
to generate *\*_CLOSED_CLASSES.json* files. 
- *2. Closed Classes Pre-processing.ipynb*: Inputs the *\*_CLOSED_CLASSES.json* files, normalizes, smooths, and finds the birth and death years of each word as well as usage statistics. Generates *CLOSED_CLASSES_SORTABLE.json*
- *3. Investigate the Closed Classes Data.ipynb*: Generates *ALL CLOSED CLASSES TOP 500s.json* and *ALL CLOSED CLASSES TOP 500s.csv*

### Data files
- *ALL CLOSED CLASSES TOP 500s.json*: Generated by *3. Investigate the Closed Classes Data.ipynb*. Contains the filtered closed lexical classes data saved as a JSON of the form
    ```
    {unigram: {pos:'pos',
               max: max_usage,
               median_all: median_all,
               median_in_use: median_in_use,
               mean_all: mean_all,
               mean_in_use: mean_in_use,
               birth_years: [year1, year2, ...],
               death_years: [year1, year2, ...]}
            ...}
    ```
    Where 
    - `max` = the maximum frequency of usage over the entire time period 
    - `me(di)an_all` is the me(di)an of the frequencies of usage at all points in the time interval.
    - `me(di)an_in_use` is the me(di)an of the frequencies of usage only when actually in use (frequency >0) 
    

- *ALL CLOSED CLASSES TOP 500s.csv*: Contains only the lexemes from *ALL CLOSED CLASSES TOP 500s.json* with their part of speech.
